# Sublease

Sublease is a tenanting engine for Rails 4.1 and greater applications using a shared database or schema. It's a Rails Engine 
designed to be lightweight, simple to implement, and easy to use. Sublease works with existing as well as new applications.

## Installation

1. On the model that you want tenanted, add the fields 'domain' and 'subdomain' through a migration. Both of these fields should be strings.

1. Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

        gem 'sublease'
        
    And then execute:
        
        $ bundle install
        
    Or install it yourself as:
        
        $ gem install sublease

1. Finally, install the Sublease configuration file. This will add config/initializers/sublease.rb to you application.


    $ rails generate sublease:install



## Usage

### Models

Sublease works by create controlled has_many and belongs_to relationships between your tenant and any other model. The has_many_subleases 
model should inherit from Sublease::Tenant and the belongs_to_subleases model should inherit from Sublease::Lodger.
 
    class Tenant < Sublease::Tenant
      has_many_subleases(:lodgers)
    end
    
    class Lodger < Sublease::Lodger
      belongs_to_sublease(:tenant)
    end

The relationships work just like normal has_many and belongs_to ActiveRecord Relationships even taking the same options. 
The difference is that the relationship is immutable and all dependencies on the relationship are overridden to call 
the destroy method. This is to ensure that all callback are called on the model in the event of a delete or destroy method call.

### Controllers

Sublease can change your tenant on the fly based on a requests subdomain, domain, or both. This switching is handled in 
any controller you want by including Sublease::TenantSwitcher. In the example below, we include it into ApplicationController 
which means that every controller in the application will check the request to make sure the correct tenant is set. 
You might not want every request to a controller checking to set the tenant so make sure you only add it to the controllers
that need it.

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      # Prevent CSRF attacks by raising an exception.
      # For APIs, you may want to use :null_session instead.
      protect_from_forgery with: :exception
      
      include Sublease::TenantSwitcher
    end

## Configuration

Sublease can be configured to set a default subdomain and/or domain. It can also be configured to determine by which method 
to switch the tenant: subdomain, domain, or subdomain and domain. See config/initializers/sublease.rb for all options.
